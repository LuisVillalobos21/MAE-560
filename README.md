# Numerical Solver for 1D PDE's
# Made for MAE 560 CFD class @ NCSU

This repository contains a numerical solver that uses finite difference methods to solve a partial differential equation (PDE). The code leverages the Eigen library for linear algebra operations.

## Dependencies:
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/): Required for linear algebra operations.
